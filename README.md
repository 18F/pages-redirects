# pages-redirects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/18F/pages-redirects.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/18F/pages-redirects)

Redirects traffic from previous pages.18f.gov sites to their new URLs, which must
be a subdomain of `18f.gov` (eg `pages.18f.gov/boop` â†’ `boop.18f.gov`).

## Adding a new redirect

To add a new redirect from a retired pages.18f.gov to its new 18f.gov-subdomain home,
you will need to edit [`pages.yml`](/pages.yml). Please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/18F/pages-redirects/pull/new/master)
with your modifications.

If you need to add a simple redirect of `pages.18f.gov/site-name` to `site-name.18f.gov`,
simply add a new line to the `pages.yml` that looks like:

```yml
- site-name
```

If you need to change the name of the old page to something new, like
`pages.18f.gov/old-name` to `new-name.18f.gov`,
add lines of the following form to `pages.yml`:

```yml
- from: old-name
  to: new-name
```

Once your changes are merged into `master` by an administrator,
the `pages-redirects` app will be redeployed by Travis and your redirects
should start working within a few minutes.

## Developing

This is a NodeJS-based that project uses [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing node dependencies.
After making sure you have it installed, run `yarn` to install dependencies.

The NodeJS code (called from [`build-nginx-configs.js`](/build-nginx-configs.js)), reads an array of sites to
redirect from the [`pages.yml`](/pages.yml) file and inserts new NGINX rewrite rules
into the [`nginx.conf.njk`](/templates/nginx.conf.njk) template in [`templates/`](/templates).
The resulting `nginx.conf` files (one for testing in [Docker](#local-docker) and one
for the production site) are written to the `out/` directory.

## Testing

To run unit tests, run `npm test`.

### Integration Tests

#### Local Docker

You can run integration tests locally against a Docker container.
First make sure you have [Docker][] and [Docker Compose][] installed, and maybe
give the [18F Docker guide][] a read.

Then build and run tests in docker-compose network:

```sh
npm run build-docker && npm run test-docker
```

#### Real server

To run integration tests against a real server:

```sh
TARGET_HOST=<FULL_URL_TOSERVER> npm run test-integration
```

For example:

```sh
TARGET_HOST=https://pages-redirects.app.cloud.gov npm run test-integration
```

## Deploying

This is deployed in GovCloud cloud.gov:

- org: `gsa-18f-federalist`
- space: `redirects`

### Automated Deployments

This app is automatically deployed by Travis when commits are pushed to the
`master` branch (such as from a merged Pull Request). Deployments are done with
the [cf-autopilot][] plugin so that there will be no downtime.

See [`.travis.yml`](/.travis.yml) and [`deploy-travis.sh`](/deploy-travis.sh) for details.

### Manual Deployments

To manually deploy:

```sh
npm run build-configs
cf push -f manifests/manifest-<target>.yml`
```
